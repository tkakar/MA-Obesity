README - The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites and screencast videos. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.

# Goal of project
Through this project we want to highlight the state of obesity in Massachusetts, socio-economic data of the state, some of the key obesity related factors and data of federal programs. Our goal is to help obesity policy and program decision makers in planning and allocating federal budgets to various federal aid programs.

# Overview of files
The files consists of data that includes all the data used in the project, scripts that have the javascript used. The libraries folder contains the available code we have used such as ma-counties.json for counties map. 

# Features of the project
* By selecting any county on the map all the charts are updated automatically for that county. 
* We have provided a drop-down menu with each chart too, so that user can check the county anywhere they want without scrolling up to the map. 
* For users' convenient exploration we have provided another drop-down menu with each graph that gives a comparison of the selected county with the state's average, with the most obese county (Nantucket) and less obese county (Hamshire).
