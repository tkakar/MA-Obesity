# Goal of project
Through this project we want to highlight the state of obesity in Massachusetts, socio-economic data of the state, some of the key obesity related factors and data of federal programs. Our goal is to help obesity policy and program decision makers in planning and allocating federal budgets to various federal aid programs.

# Overview of files
The files consists of data that includes all the data files used in the project, scripts contains the main javascript code. The libraries folder contains the available code we used such as ma-counties.json for counties map. The folder styles contains all the CSS used in the project.

# Features of the project
* The county map does not only show the obesity intensity, but also shows the change in obesity percentage upon hover. 
* By selecting any county on the map all the charts are updated automatically for that county. 
* We have provided a drop-down menu with each chart too, so that users can explore the county anywhere they want without scrolling up to the map. 
* For users' convenient exploration we have provided another drop-down menu with each graph that gives a comparison of the selected county with the state's average, with the most obese county (Nantucket) and less obese county (Hampshire). This menu is not synchronized i.e. upon changing one charts compare menu, does not effect the others, so that user can explore the trends across each chart individually.
* The hover over functionality is implemented for each chart for the sake of understanding the data.

# Contribution:
* Chitrakraj: Created map and integration
* SuwDB: Created grouped bar charts and interaction among charts
* Tkakar: Created the socioeconomic charts and layout.

All of us worked on writing the process book, website layout and screen cast.
